# Skip (or ignore) your local file from Git History.
#
# --skip-worktree is useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file
# ever because developers should change it. For example, if the main repository
# upstream hosts some production-ready configuration files and you donâ€™t want to
# accidentally commit changes to those files
