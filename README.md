## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## install

Just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/oieduardorabelo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in .dotfiles to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within ~/.dotfiles.
